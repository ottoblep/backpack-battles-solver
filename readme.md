# Backpack Battles Solver

This repo aims to solve the placement/optimization problem posed in the game [Backpack Battles](https://playwithfurcifer.itch.io/backpack-battles).

## Approaches to placement problem
• Local search, in particular simulated
annealing
• Recursive partitioning, in particular min-cut
• Analytical (most notably, quadratic)
placement
• These are the only three basic approaches
used in practice, for more than 20 years.
